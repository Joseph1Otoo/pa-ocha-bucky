Model Input and Output
======================

Input
=====
The Bucky model uses two main sources of input: the input graph and CDC-recommended parameters. The input graph contains data regarding demographics, geographic information, and historical case information.

CDC-Recommended Parameters
--------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published pandemic planning scenarios [7] which contain recommended parameters describing biological and epidemiological parameters. Of these five planning scenarios, OCHA-Bucky utilizes scenario 5, which contains the CDCâ€™s current best estimates for disease severity and transmission. These parameters are described in detail, based on information available from the CDC, and summarized in Table 2.

Output
======
The Bucky model generates one file per Monte Carlo run. This data is post-processed to combine data across all dates and simulations. It can then be aggregated at desired geographic levels. A separate file is created for each requested administrative levevel, with each row indexed by data, admin ID, and quantile. The columns of this output file are described in the tables below.

==========  ===========
Index name  Description
==========  ===========
adm*        The adm ID corresponding to the geographic level (i.e. adm2 ID)
date        The date
q           Quantile value
